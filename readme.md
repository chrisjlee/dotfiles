<h1>Dotfiles</h1>

This project is just a collection of dotfiles for my system. Just wanted to keep them on the cloud. The setup also contains shortcuts to paths to a xampp setup as well as drush. I normally use these dotfiles on a ubuntu machine for work.

<h2>About the files</h2>

.bash_profile - where all the alias are stored
.prompt - contains the externalized PS/1 Configurations
.vim - Folder contains vim configurations
