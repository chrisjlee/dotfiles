<h1>Dotfiles</h1>

This project is just a collection of dotfiles for my home folder. My intention is to keep them on the cloud and help others that may want a similar setup. The setup also contains shortcuts to paths to a xampp setup as well as drush. I normally use these dotfiles on a ubuntu machine for work.

## What are these files?

`.bash_profile` - where all the alias are stored
`.bash_alias` - where aliases for bash are stored
`.prompt` - contains the externalized PS/1 Configurations
`.zsh_alias` - my alternate alias if you use zsh; it mirrors the bash_alias file
`.vim` - Folder contains vim configurations

---

## Installation
* Clone this package and rename it to ~/.dotfiles . Make sure it's saved inside your home folder</li>
* Next, run the setup file from the command line: <code>./setup.sh</code><br>It copies all the vim, zsh, and bashrc files into your home folder.
